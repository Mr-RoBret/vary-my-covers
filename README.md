<<<<<<< HEAD

This application allows a user to choose multiple files from a chosen location, which it will use to populate a scrollable carousel. No database is used,
only a reader which grabs preview images of the files and displays them. 

Currently commented out is the functionality that will provide a strip of thumbnails below the larger carousel. 

/** Issue I'm currently trying to figure out: I can't seem to get the FileList object created by the reader into an array, which is an integral part
of how my application determines where to apply the '.current-slide' class. 
=======
A simple website that will take a user's input images and turn them into a carousel, using html, css, and javascript.
## Long Term Goals
Eventually, I will develop this as an app that will display any of the current week's comic book new releases, and allow the user to flip through (and even vote on) any variant covers for each issue.
