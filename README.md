## vary-my-covers
This application allows a user to choose multiple files from a chosen location, which it will use to populate a scrollable carousel. No database is used,
only a reader which grabs preview images of the files and displays them. 

### Long Term Goals
Eventually, I will develop this as an app that will display any of the current week's comic book new releases, and allow the user to flip through (and even vote on) any variant covers for each issue.
