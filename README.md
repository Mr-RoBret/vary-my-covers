# vary-my-covers
A simple website that will take a user's input images and turn them into a carousel, using html, css, and javascript.
## Long Term Goals
Eventually, I will develop this as an app that will display any of the current week's comic book new releases, and allow the user to flip through (and even vote on) any variant covers for each issue.
